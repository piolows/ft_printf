# ft_printf - 42
Ft_printf project from the 42 cursus.

This project is a recreation of the printf function from the C library <stdio.h>. It is fairly straightforward and uses many functions from the previous project (libft). Using write and utilizing its return value made it easy to simulate printf and its return value. This project is also an introduction to variadic functions.

Project completed on November 16 2023 (100/100).
